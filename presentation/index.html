### Example React Component

```jsx
function MyHeader({ companyName }: { companyName: string }) {
  const loadData = () => {
    // ...
  };

  return (
    <header className="header">
      <img src="assets/logo.png" />
      <h1>{companyName}</h1>
      <div className="nav">
        <a href="/home">Home</a>
        <a href="/account" onClick={loadData}>Account</a>
      </div>
    </header>

```jsx
function MyHeader({ companyName }: { companyName: string }) {
  const goToHome = ...
  const goToAccounts = ...
  return (
    <View style={styles.header}>
      <Image source={require('assets/logo.png')} />
      <Text>{companyName}</Text>
      <View style={styles.nav}>
        <TouchableHighlight onPress={goToHome}>
