### Aim - to answer the following questions:

- What is React Native?
- What are its capabilities and limitations?
- How does it work?
- How can it help me build apps more efficiently?
- Why would I consider using it for personal projects?
- Why would Santander consider using it for enterprise grade projects?

### Example React Component

```jsx
function MyHeader({ companyName }: { companyName: string }) {
  const loadData = () => {
    // ...
  };

  return (
    <header className="header">
      <img src="assets/logo.png" />
      <h1>{companyName}</h1>
      <div className="nav">
        <a href="/home">Home</a>
        <a href="/account" onClick={loadData}>Account</a>
      </div>
    </header>
  );
}
```

### Example React Native Component

```jsx
function MyHeader({ companyName }: { companyName: string }) {
  const goToHome = ...
  const goToAccounts = ...
  return (
    <View style={styles.header}>
      <Image source={require('assets/logo.png')} />
      <Text>{companyName}</Text>
      <View style={styles.nav}>
        <TouchableHighlight onPress={goToHome}>
          <Text>Home</Text>
        </TouchableHighlight>
        <TouchableHighlight onPress={goToAccounts}>
          <Text>Accounts</Text>
        </TouchableHighlight>
      </View>
    </View>
  );

### How do we build apps with React Native?

We have two main choices:

#### Native platform tools

Use the React Native CLI, along with Xcode and Android Studio to build and run your app.

- Requires some knowledge of the native iOS/Android development tools
- Allows you to add your own native code to the application
- Full flexibility

### How do we build apps with React Native?

We have two main choices:

#### Expo

A set of tools and services that simplify the build and development processes, with some additional features.

- Provides a free cloud build service
- OTA updates
- Additional platform APIs
- Simplified on-device testing
- Unable to add or modify native code
